# 422 Unprocessable Entity

When we receive an invalid ```POST``` or ```PUT``` request, a ```422 Unprocessable Entity``` response will be returned along with a response body containing the errors with the request.

The error response will follow the following format:

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "attribute": ["error text"]
  }
}
```

For example if you try to create a [Contact](https://github.com/aceofsales/api-docs/blob/master/endpoints/contacts.md) without a first or last name, you will get the following response body:

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "first_name": ["can\'t be blank"],
    "last_name": ["can\'t be blank"]
  }
}
